## Assignments:

This class requires weekly "rapid reading," weekly vocabulary quizzes, and a final exegetical project. Assignment details will be available to learners when the semester begins.

1. Rapid Reading: Each week, learners will have prepared by rapidly reading a lengthy span of text (perhaps 8-12 chapters). This isn't deep reading, but rapid reading.
1. Vocabulary Quizzes (weekly): We use a frequency list of NT Greek words, starting with the most common.
1. Final Exegetical Project: A short exegetical paper, followed by a verse-by-verse grammatical/syntactical commentary.

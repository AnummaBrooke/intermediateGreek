## Texts and Resources:

In addition to the below, you will probably want access to your introductory grammar textbook, whatever it was.

1. A critical edition of the Greek New Testament, whether 
    * the red _Greek New Testament_ with dictionary, currently in 5th revised edition by American Bible Society (about $45), or 
    * the blue "Nestle Aland" _Novum Testament Graece_, currently in 28th edition by German Bible Society or Institute for New Testament Textual Research (about $45).

    Earlier editions that you already own are fine!

1. Wallace, Daniel B. _Greek Grammar Beyond the Basics: An Exegetical Syntax of the New Testament._  Grand Rapids, Mich.: Zondervan, 1996 (about $35).

1. A good lexicon. Usual is "BADG" in some edition/revision: e.g., Bauer et al, _A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature, 3rd Edition_ (about $150!). Or, you may prefer "Liddell and Scott's", especially if you plan to read in the Classics: e.g., Liddell, Henry George, and Robert Scott, _A Greek-English Lexicon, Ninth Edition with a Revised Supplement_ (about $175!).

    Let the instructor know if you have questions about purchasing a lexicon. The cost is high, but you'll use it forever.

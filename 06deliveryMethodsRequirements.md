##Delivery Method and Requirements:

This course meets face-to-face, weekly. There are no unusual technological requirements, though the usual institutional computer requirements may apply.

Learners may find it helpful, especially when writing a paper for the course, to learn to use Unicode Greek in their word processor of choice, including the installation of an appropriate "keyboard layout." We will spend some time in class offering guidance on this, but learners will accomplish this on their own time. Don't worry, it's not actually that daunting, and the ability to write proper Greek in a word-processing document is more than worth the effort.

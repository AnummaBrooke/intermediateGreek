## Learning Goals and Outcomes:

Learners will grow in their confidence reading fluently (aloud) and at a more accelerated pace than in elementary Greek 1 and 2. We will naturally find opportunity in the course to review the _morphology_ (how the forms of words make meaning) to which learners have already been exposed in elementary Greek. However, we will focus on _syntax_ (how forms are used in combination to make meaning in clauses and sentences).

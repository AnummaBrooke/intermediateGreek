# Intermediate New Testament Greek (12-543, 2016)

## Description

The primary aim of this reading course is to develop fluency in the translation of Biblical (Koine) Greek prose, through consolidation and expansion of the student's knowledge of grammar and vocabulary.  Secondary attention will be given to the introduction of issues of literary analysis and text-critical methodology.

## Book List

In addition to the below, you will probably want access to your introductory grammar textbook, whatever it was.

1. A critical edition of the Greek New Testament, whether 
	* the red _Greek New Testament_ with dictionary, currently in 5th revised edition by American Bible Society (about $45), or 
	* the blue "Nestle Aland" _Novum Testament Graece_, currently in 28th edition by German Bible Society or Institute for New Testament Textual Research (about $45).

	Earlier editions that you already own are fine!

1. Wallace, Daniel B. _Greek Grammar Beyond the Basics: An Exegetical Syntax of the New Testament._  Grand Rapids, Mich.: Zondervan, 1996 (about $35).

1. A good lexicon. Usual is "BADG" in some edition/revision: e.g., Bauer et al, _A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature, 3rd Edition_ (about $150!). Or, you may prefer "Liddell and Scott's", especially if you plan to read in the Classics: e.g., Liddell, Henry George, and Robert Scott, _A Greek-English Lexicon, Ninth Edition with a Revised Supplement_ (about $175!).

	Let the instructor know if you have questions about purchasing a lexicon. The cost is high, but you'll use it forever.

## Assignments

This class requires weekly "rapid reading," occasional formative vocabulary quizzes, and a final exegetical project. Assignment details will be available to learners when the semester begins.

1. **Rapid Reading:** Each week, learners will have prepared by rapidly reading a lengthy span of text (perhaps 8-12 chapters). This isn't deep reading, but rapid reading.
1. **Vocabulary Quizzes (weekly):** We use a frequency list of NT Greek words, starting with the most common.
1. **Final Exegetical Project:** A short exegetical paper, followed by a verse-by-verse grammatical/syntactical commentary.
